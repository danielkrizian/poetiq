/ Assumptions: 
/ fill rate: 100% of the order size
/ fill price: at price traded at the time immediately following the order
/ speed of execution: immediately following the order (first after)
/ costs:
/ 	- market impact: none
/   - bid/ask: none
/   - fees: none
/ supported order types:
/   - none explicitly. Implicitly: MARKET(?), MOC, MOO

/ Order bundles are submitted in a table but to be processed one row at a time (TODO)

fill simulator subscribes to (daily) trade events to maintain control table from which to fill orders at last traded price (daily close). Control table is inspired by (more sophisticated) gbkr qx virtual exchange simulator:
